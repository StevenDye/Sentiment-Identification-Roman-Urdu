Objective: Train a sentiment classifier on a corpus of the provided documents. Your goal is to maximize accuracy. There is special interest in being able to accurately detect negative sentiment. The training data includes documents from a wide variety of sources, not merely social media, and some of it may be inconsistently labeled. Please describe the business outcomes in your work sample including how data limitations impact your results and how these limitations could be addressed in a larger project.

Data limitations:

-- Lack of full stopwords list
-- Unbalanced data
-- Sparse matrix seems to be easier to handle then arrays

With BERT, no pre-processing is needed.


Submit your work sample as a single pdf or html file that is comprehensive with respect to your thought process, code, findings, and recommendations (ie a notebook). You may submit other documents if you wish, but compressed files will not be accepted.
